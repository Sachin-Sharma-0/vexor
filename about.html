    <h1>About VEXOR</h1>
    <p>
      VEXOR is an independent workforce audit practice focused on objective capability evaluation,
      execution risk identification, and organizational readiness assessment.
    </p>
  </div>
</header>


<section>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="card">
      <h2>What We Do</h2>
      <p>
        VEXOR conducts structured audits of individuals, teams, and organizations to determine
        whether people, roles, and responsibilities are aligned with real execution demands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our evaluations go beyond resumes, designations, and self-reported performance.
        We assess actual capability depth, decision-making maturity, dependency risks,
        and readiness for current and future operating conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        VEXOR audits deliver structured findings, risk indicators, and decision inputs — not implementation mandates or advisory ownership.
      </p>

    <h2>Why VEXOR Exists</h2>
    <p>
      Modern organizations make critical decisions based on financial reports,
      operational metrics, and market data — yet workforce capability is often
      assumed rather than verified.
    </p>
    <p>
      VEXOR was established to address this gap.
      To provide leadership with an objective view of whether people, roles,
      and structures are truly capable of supporting stated goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our work exists for organizations that value truth over comfort
      and clarity over assumption.

      <h2>Who Engages VEXOR</h2>
      <p>
        VEXOR works with founders, CXOs, board members, and senior leadership
        teams who require an unbiased view of workforce capability before
        making high-impact decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical engagement triggers include scaling challenges,
        execution failures, leadership dependency risks, restructuring,
        or concerns about future readiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Organizations seeking validation, cosmetic audits, or
        pre-decided outcomes are not a fit.

    <h2>What We Are Not</h2>
    <p>
      VEXOR is not a recruitment agency, staffing vendor, training provider, or consulting firm.
      We do not sell implementation services, coaching programs, or transformation roadmaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not align incentives with hiring, promotions, layoffs, or organizational restructuring.
      Our role ends at evaluation and reporting.
    </p>
    <p>
      This separation is intentional. It preserves audit integrity and prevents conflicts of interest.

  <div class="container">
    <div class="card">
      <h2>How We Operate</h2>
      <p>
        Every VEXOR engagement follows a defined audit framework with clearly documented scope,
        evaluation criteria, and evidence-backed observations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Engagements begin with either a written request or a professional discussion to assess
        suitability, audit depth, and organizational context.
      </p>
      <p>
        Commercial terms, timelines, and audit boundaries are finalized only after mutual clarity
        is established.

  <div class="container">
    <h2>Independence & Ethics</h2>
    <p>
      VEXOR operates independently of client management decisions and does not participate
      in internal politics, performance disputes, or employment actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Audit findings are documented objectively and delivered without dilution,
      alignment pressure, or outcome influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe workforce truth, even when uncomfortable, is more valuable than
      agreeable narratives.

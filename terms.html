    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1><br>

    <h2>Nature of Services</h2>
    <p>
      VEXOR provides independent, evaluative organizational and workforce-level audits.
      Services are diagnostic and analytical in nature and do not constitute consulting,
      legal, financial, HR advisory, or individual performance evaluation services.

    </p><br>

    <h2>Engagement & Scope</h2>
    <p>
      Each engagement is governed by a defined scope, methodology, timeline, and commercial terms agreed prior to
      initiation. Any work outside the agreed scope requires explicit confirmation.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      In the event of any conflict, formally executed engagement-specific
      agreements shall prevail over these general terms.
    </p><br>


    <h2>Fees & Payments</h2>
    <p>
      Discussion fees, where applicable, cover time allocated for engagement
      qualification and are non-refundable.
      Audit fees are payable as per agreed milestones. Reports may be withheld until full payment is received.
    </p><br>

    <h2>Use of Reports & Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      All audit reports and materials remain the intellectual property of VEXOR. Clients may use findings internally for
      decision-making purposes but may not
      reproduce, distribute, summarize, extract, or publish reports or derivative
      materials without prior written consent.

    </p><br>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      VEXOR shall not be liable for decisions, actions, or outcomes arising from
      the use or interpretation of audit findings. In no event shall VEXOR be
      liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, or reputational damages.
      Any liability, if established, shall be limited to the fees paid for the
      specific engagement.

    </p><br>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>
      VEXOR reserves the right to terminate an engagement if cooperation is withheld, information is misrepresented, or
      professional boundaries are compromised.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      Termination does not relieve the client of payment obligations
      for work completed up to the termination date.
    </p><br>


    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which
      VEXOR maintains
      its principal operations.

    </p><br>

    <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By requesting a discussion or entering into an engagement, clients acknowledge that they have read, understood,
      and accepted these terms.

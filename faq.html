  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1><br>

  <!-- Engagement Basics -->
  <h2>Engagement Basics</h2>

  <p><strong>What does VEXOR actually do?</strong><br>
    VEXOR conducts independent audits of employees, teams, and organizations to evaluate capability alignment, execution readiness, and workforce risk. Our role is evaluative, not advisory or operational.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Is VEXOR a consulting or recruitment firm?</strong><br>
    No. VEXOR does not provide consulting, recruitment, coaching, outsourcing, or implementation services. We focus exclusively on objective evaluation.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Who typically engages VEXOR?</strong><br>
    Founders, CXOs, boards, and senior leadership teams seeking factual clarity before making people, structure, or strategy decisions.
  </p><br>

  <!-- Audit Scope & Process -->
  <h2>Audit Scope & Process</h2>

  <p><strong>How does an audit engagement begin?</strong><br>
    Engagements begin with a professional discussion to assess suitability, scope, and expectations. Some discussions are paid; limited written clarification may be provided without charge.
  </p>

  <p><strong>What does the audit process involve?</strong><br>
    Audits may include structured interviews, role-based assessments, behavioral evaluation, documentation review, and observation. The exact approach depends on scope and context.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Do you audit individuals or entire organizations?</strong><br>
    Both. VEXOR conducts individual employee audits, team-level audits, and organization-wide workforce evaluations.
  </p><br>

  <!-- Reporting & Outcomes -->
  <h2>Reporting & Outcomes</h2>

  <p><strong>What do clients receive after an audit?</strong><br>
    Clients receive a structured report outlining observations, risk indicators, capability alignment, and execution concerns relevant to the defined scope.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Does VEXOR provide recommendations?</strong><br>
    Reports may include professional observations and directional considerations. However, VEXOR does not prescribe actions or participate in implementation decisions.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Can audit findings affect employee outcomes?</strong><br>
    Audit findings may inform leadership decisions related to role changes, restructuring, or performance actions. Responsibility for such decisions rests solely with the client.
  </p><br>

  <!-- Commercial & Practical -->
  <h2>Commercial & Practical Questions</h2>

  <p><strong>Are discussions paid?</strong><br>
    Some professional discussions are paid and non-refundable. This is communicated in advance.
  </p>

  <p><strong>How is pricing determined?</strong><br>
    Pricing depends on audit scope, depth, number of participants, location, and customization requirements.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Do you conduct remote audits?</strong><br>
    Yes. Audits may be conducted virtually, on-site, or in hybrid formats depending on engagement needs.
  </p><br>

  <!-- Boundaries & Limitations -->
  <h2>Boundaries & Limitations</h2>

  <p><strong>Does VEXOR guarantee outcomes?</strong><br>
    No. Audits provide an assessment at a point in time. Business outcomes depend on client decisions and subsequent actions.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Is audit data confidential?</strong><br>
    Yes. All engagement data is treated as confidential and used solely for the purpose of the audit.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Can reports be shared publicly?</strong><br>
    No. Audit reports may not be shared externally without prior written consent from VEXOR.

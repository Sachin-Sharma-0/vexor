        VEXOR is an independent workforce audit firm evaluating whether employees, teams,

        Independent evaluations focused on execution risk, role misalignment, and workforce readiness — before these issues surface as business failures.

<!-- Problem Statement -->

<section class="problem">
  <div class="container narrow">
    <h2>The Most Audited Asset Is Often the Least Verified</h2>
    <p>
      Organizations routinely audit finance, security, compliance, and quality.
      Yet the human workforce — the single biggest determinant of execution success —
      often remains unevaluated beyond resumes and annual appraisals.
    </p>
    <p>
      As organizations scale, decision-makers lose visibility into real capability levels.
      Delegation increases. Skill gaps compound silently. Strategic execution risk rises.

<!-- Value Explanation -->

<section class="value">
  <div class="container narrow">
    <h2>Why Workforce Auditing Matters</h2>
    <ul class="value-points">
      <li>Unverified capability leads to delayed execution and hidden losses</li>
      <li>Misaligned roles reduce ROI on payroll and hiring</li>
      <li>Skill stagnation increases dependency on a few individuals</li>
      <li>Leadership decisions are weakened without objective people data</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="value-note">
      VEXOR audits are not opinions. They are structured evaluations designed to
      inform critical people and strategy decisions.

<section class="economic-risk">
  <div class="container narrow">
    <h2>The Hidden Cost of Capability Mismatch</h2>

    <p>
      Workforce risk rarely appears as a single failure. It accumulates quietly through
      delayed execution, rework, missed decisions, and dependency on a few individuals.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider a simplified illustration:
    </p>

    <ul class="value-points">
      <li>An employee with a monthly cost of ₹1,50,000 (salary, benefits, overhead)</li>
      <li>Operating at 60–70% effective role alignment</li>
      <li>Creates an estimated inefficiency cost of ₹45,000–₹60,000 per month</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="value-note">
      This is not a claim of loss, but a conservative illustration of how misalignment,
      skill gaps, and unclear accountability translate into economic drag over time.
    </p>

    <p class="value-note">
      At scale, these risks compound across teams and leadership layers — often remaining
      invisible until outcomes are already affected.

  <!-- Problem Statement -->

  <section class="problem">
    <div class="container narrow">
      <h2>The Most Audited Asset Is Often the Least Verified</h2>
      <p>
        Organizations routinely audit finance, security, compliance, and quality.
        Yet the human workforce — the single biggest determinant of execution success —
        often remains unevaluated beyond resumes and annual appraisals.
      </p>
      <p>
        As organizations scale, decision-makers lose visibility into real capability levels.
        Delegation increases. Skill gaps compound silently. Strategic execution risk rises.

      <h2>Why Workforce Auditing Matters</h2>
      <ul class="value-points">
        <li>Unverified capability leads to delayed execution and hidden losses</li>
        <li>Misaligned roles reduce ROI on payroll and hiring</li>
        <li>Skill stagnation increases dependency on a few individuals</li>
        <li>Leadership decisions are weakened without objective people data</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="value-note">
        VEXOR audits are not opinions. They are structured evaluations designed to
        inform critical people and strategy decisions.

    </div>
  </section>

  <section class="economic-risk">
    <div class="container narrow">
      <h2>The Hidden Cost of Capability Mismatch</h2>

      <p>
        Workforce risk rarely appears as a single failure. It accumulates quietly through
        delayed execution, rework, missed decisions, and dependency on a few individuals.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider a simplified illustration:
      </p>

      <ul class="value-points">
        <li>An employee with a monthly cost of ₹1,50,000 (salary, benefits, overhead)</li>
        <li>Operating at 60–70% effective role alignment</li>
        <li>Creates an estimated inefficiency cost of ₹45,000–₹60,000 per month</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="value-note">
        This is not a claim of loss, but a conservative illustration of how misalignment,
        skill gaps, and unclear accountability translate into economic drag over time.
      </p>

      <p class="value-note">
        At scale, these risks compound across teams and leadership layers — often remaining
        invisible until outcomes are already affected.

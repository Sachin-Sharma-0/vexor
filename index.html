<!-- Problem Statement -->

<section class="problem">
  <div class="container narrow">
    <h2>The Most Audited Asset Is Often the Least Verified</h2>
    <p>
      Organizations routinely audit finance, security, compliance, and quality.
      Yet the human workforce — the single biggest determinant of execution success —
      often remains unevaluated beyond resumes and annual appraisals.
    </p>
    <p>
      As organizations scale, decision-makers lose visibility into real capability levels.
      Delegation increases. Skill gaps compound silently. Strategic execution risk rises.
